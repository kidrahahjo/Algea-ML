# Algea-ML
<p> Creating a model for a research project is not an easy task. The algorithms used in this project are the basic ideas behind machine learning. Apart from the simple algorithms implemented, <b>Genetic Programming</b> is also used to fit the dataset</p>

# What is the project?
<p>The basic idea behing this ML project is the <b>Pretreatment of algal biomass using fungal enzyme.</b></p>
<p>The structure of microalgae is similar to terrestrial plants. The algal cell wall is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The recalcitrant nature of the cell wall makes it hard to recover the energy molecules from the biomass. To recover the energy molecules efficiently, which support optimal biofuel conversion. different pretreatment has been tested in the past.
Enzymatic pretreatment depends on pH, temperature, enzyme load, agitation, substrate load, as well as the digestion time. Optimal combination of these parameters can drastically increase the efficacy.</p>

# Why is this task difficult?
<p>It is not feasible to conduct the experiment multiple times and hence we have a very small dataset with 5 features.</p> 
<p>I'm currently working on my Genetic Programming model and hope to fit that model soon. I have tried to make the code clean before pushing it on Github.</p>
